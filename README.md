# Basic React Blog

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

This is a very simple React blog, demonstrating how to make one.

I wrote about it on [JavaScriptPage](https://javascriptpage.com/building-simple-blog-using-react). Live demo [here](https://blog-basic.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
